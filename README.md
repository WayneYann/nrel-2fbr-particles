# Particle characterization for the NREL 2FBR system

Particle samples of loblolly pine, fresh sand, used sand, fresh catalyst, and
used catalyst were obtained from a single experimental run of the NREL 2FBR
system. Sieve measurements of the particles were conducted at UTK. Analyses of
the particles were performed by [Galbraith][gal]. Size measurements of the
particles were performed by [Microtrac][mic]. More information about the NREL
2FBR system is available at [ccpcode.github.io/docs-2fbr/][nre]. A summary of
each folder in this repository is provided below.

**code** - This folder contains Python code provided as Jupyter notebooks or
individual scripts for analyzing data from the sieve measurements, Galbraith
analysis, and Microtrac measurements.

**data** - Data files for the sieve measurements, Galbraith analyses, and
Microtrac measurements. There is also a spreadsheet from NREL with various
analysis results. Galbraith provided a PDF of their analyses which was used to
create an Excel spreadsheet and CSV file. Microtrac provided their
measurements as Excel spreadsheets which were used to create the CSV files.
Sieve measurements were recorded by hand then entered into CSV files.

**results** - Plots generated from the code files and Jupyter notebooks.
